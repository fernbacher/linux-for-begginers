# DISTROS I RECOMMEND FOR A BEGINNER

1. [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/)
-I recommend XFCE from the official editions.

2. [Pop-OS](https://pop.system76.com/)
-Nvidia version if you have NVIDIA GPU, obviously. Otherwise the normal one.

3. [Arch-Linux-GUI](https://archlinuxgui.in/)
-There are multiple DE versions, aswell as 2 WM versions. If you want to use your keyboard alot more and not focus on GUI anymore, go for WM, also alot slimmer on resourcers

4. [Debian](https://www.debian.org/)
-Usually used for servers, it uses LTS (long term support) kernel, the base of ubuntu and many many others.

5. [Devuan](https://www.devuan.org/)
-Debian without system-d [read about why system-d is bloat](https://people.debian.org/~stapelberg/2013/06/09/systemd-bloat.html)

6. [Artix](https://artixlinux.org/)
-Arch without system-d

# CUSTOM KERNEL

1. [Linux-Zen](https://github.com/zen-kernel/zen-kernel)
-Result of a collaborative effort of kernel hackers to provide the best Linux kernel possible for everyday systems. Some more details can be found on [Liquorix](https://liquorix.net)

2. [XanMod](https://xanmod.org)
-XanMod is a general-purpose Linux kernel distribution with custom settings and new features. Built to provide a stable, responsive and smooth desktop experience.

3. [Configure Your Own](https://youtu.be/NVWVHiLx1sU)
-Kinda outdated, but its a decent base to see what you can do and how hard/easy it is.
