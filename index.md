## DISTROS I RECOMMEND FOR A BEGINNER

1. [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/)
- I recommend XFCE from the official editions.

- Nvidia version if you have NVIDIA GPU, obviously. Otherwise the normal one.

3. [Arch-Linux-GUI](https://archlinuxgui.in/)
- There are multiple DE versions, aswell as 2 WM versions. If you want to use your keyboard alot more and not focus on GUI anymore, go for WM, also alot slimmer on resourcers.

- Usually used for servers, it uses LTS (long term support) kernel, the base of ubuntu and many many others.

5. [Devuan](https://www.devuan.org/)

6. [Artix](https://artixlinux.org/)
- Arch without system-d.

## DO I NEED TO USE THE TERMINAL IN LINUX?

>Short answer, **Yes**.

>Basic answer; You don't have to use it, but you should learn how to use it to an extent, it is about your full control over your Operating System, GUI applications can cover up terminal usage, but its not unlimited. Slowly but surely you should learn how to use the terminal for basic usage and even advanced.
