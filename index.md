# Distros i recommend

1. [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/)
I recommend XFCE from the official editions.

2. [Pop-OS](https://pop.system76.com/)
Nvidia version if you have NVIDIA GPU, obviously. Otherwise the normal one.

3. [Arch-Linux-GUI](https://archlinuxgui.in/)
There are multiple DE versions, aswell as 2 WM versions. If you want to use your keyboard alot more and not focus on GUI anymore, go for WM, also alot slimmer on resourcers

4. [Debian](https://www.debian.org/)
Usually used for servers, it uses LTS (long term support) kernel, the base of ubuntu and many many others.
